# Product/Customer Database SQL Code

This repository contains SQL code I used to manage my product/customer database. The SQL scripts include stored procedures to perform various operations on the database.

## Stored Procedures
1. `GetCustomerByID`: Retrieves customer details by customer ID.
2. `InsertCustomer`: Inserts a new customer into the database.
3. `UpdateCustomer`: Updates customer information, specifically the phone number, for a given customer ID.
4. `GetTotalSalesByCustomer`: Calculates the total sales for each customer based on their orders.
5. `DeleteCustomer`: Deletes a customer and their associated orders from the database.

Feel free to use and modify these stored procedures to suit your specific requirements.

## How to Use

1. Execute the SQL script in a database management system that supports SQL.
2. Once the script is executed, you can call the stored procedures using the appropriate parameters to perform the desired operations.

Please ensure that you have appropriate access rights and take necessary precautions while executing these scripts.
